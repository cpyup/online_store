# Online Store

## Project Summary

Online Store is a Java CLI application, implementing a mock (cash based) storefront. This application loads the products from the inventory.csv data file then displays them to the user. The user can then select which items to add to the cart and proceed to checkout.

## User Stories

> As a user, I would like to be able to load the inventory data to the application from an external source, so the application is populated with the most current information.

> As a user, I would like to search the product inventory for the id of the product I am looking for so that I can easily locate it for adding to my cart.

> As a user, I would like to be able to process payment for the products currently in my cart, so that I can complete my purchase.

> As a user, I would like to have a receipt of my transaction saved to my computer and displayed after purchasing, so that I can retain for my financial records.

> As a user, I would like to to view the available products in a simple format inside the application so I can easily browse the current inventory.

> As a user, I would like the user interface to be consistent throughout the application so that there is never any confusion when navigating.

> As a user, I would like a way to view the items currently in my cart so that I can decide if I am ready to checkout.

> As a busy user, I would like to add multiple products to my cart at once, that way if I have to order more than one, I have less typing to do.

> As a user with memory issues, I would to be able to search for fragments of product IDs, not just the exact ID, so that if I cannot remember exactly what I am looking for, I have the ability to better narrow down my options.

> As a potential contributor to the project, I would like for the code to be as clean and efficient as possible, so that I can easily understand, navigate, and contribute.
